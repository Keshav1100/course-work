        Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is
        crucial for writing code that is easy to understand, maintain, and
        collaborate on. Clear identifiers improve code readability by conveying
        the purpose and intent of variables, making it easier for developers
        (including yourself) to grasp the functionality of the code. Here are
        some key reasons why meaningful variable names are important:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Readability:</h3>
            Descriptive variable names make code more readable. When someone
            reads your code, they should be able to understand the purpose of a
            variable without having to refer to extensive documentation.
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Maintainability:</h3>
            Code is read more often than it is written. When you or other
            developers revisit the code for maintenance or updates, clear
            variable names significantly reduce the cognitive load and make it
            easier to comprehend the logic.
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Understanding Intent:</h3>
            Meaningful variable names convey the intent of the code. Developers
            can quickly grasp the purpose of a variable and its role in the
            overall functionality.
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Reducing Bugs:</h3>
            Misunderstandings due to unclear variable names can lead to bugs.
            When variables are named with precision, the likelihood of
            introducing errors or misunderstanding the code is minimized.
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Collaboration:</h3>
            When working in a team, descriptive variable names facilitate
            collaboration by providing a shared understanding of the codebase.
            Team members can quickly understand each other's contributions.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2><u>Examples:</u></h2>
        <p>Consider the following code snippet with poorly named variables:</p>
        <img
          src="./code_examples/ex_1.png"
          alt="code example"
          class="ans-code-example"
        />
        <p>
          In this snippet, the variable names (a, b, and c) are not meaningful.
          While the code performs a simple addition and displays the result, it
          lacks clarity about what the numbers represent.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Now, let's improve the code by using meaningful variable names:</p>
        <img
          src="./code_examples/ex_2.png"
          alt="code example"
          class="ans-code-example"
        />
        <p>
          In this improved version, variable names (firstNumber, secondNumber,
          and sumResult) clearly convey the purpose of each variable. It's now
          evident that we are working with two numbers and calculating their
          sum. This not only improves readability but also helps in maintaining
          a clear understanding of the code's intent.
