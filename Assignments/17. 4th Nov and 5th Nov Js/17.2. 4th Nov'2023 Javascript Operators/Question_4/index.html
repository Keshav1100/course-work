          Precedence and associativity are essential concepts when working with
          multiple operators in an expression. They determine the order in which
          operations are performed, ensuring that expressions are evaluated
          correctly.
        </p>

        <h2>Precedence:</h2>
        <p>
          Precedence refers to the priority or order of evaluation among
          different operators. Higher precedence operators are evaluated first.
          JavaScript follows a set of rules that dictate the precedence of
          various operators. For example, in the expression a + b * c,
          multiplication has higher precedence than addition. Therefore, the
          multiplication (*) operation is performed first, followed by addition
          (+).
        </p>

        <h2>Associativity:</h2>
        <p>
          Associativity defines the order in which operators of the same
          precedence are evaluated. It can be left-to-right or right-to-left.
          For example, in the expression a = b = c, the assignment operator (=)
          is right-to-left associative. Therefore, c is assigned to b, and then
          the result of that assignment is assigned to a.
        </p>
        <h2>Importance of Understanding Precedence and Associativity:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Correct Evaluation:</h3>
            <p>
              Understanding precedence and associativity is crucial for ensuring
              that expressions are evaluated in the correct order.
              Misunderstanding these concepts can lead to unexpected results.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Code Readability:</h3>
            <p>
              Writing code with a clear understanding of precedence and
              associativity improves readability. It helps convey the intended
              order of operations to other developers who may read or maintain
              the code.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Avoiding Errors:</h3>
            <p>
              Knowing the rules prevents common errors in expressions where the
              order of operations may be ambiguous. It helps in writing
              expressions that produce the expected outcomes.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Optimizing Code:</h3>
            <p>
              In some cases, understanding precedence can help optimize code by
              eliminating the need for unnecessary parentheses. This can lead to
              more concise and efficient expressions.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Example:</h2>
        <img
          src="./code_examples/ex_1.png"
          alt="code example"
          class="ans-code-example"
        />
        <p>
          In this example, the multiplication (*) has higher precedence than
          addition (+). Therefore, 2 * 3 is evaluated first, and then the result
          is added to 10. Understanding this precedence is essential for
          correctly predicting that result will be 16 rather than 36.
