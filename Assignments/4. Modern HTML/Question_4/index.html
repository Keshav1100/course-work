      Q. List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML.
    </h1>
    <div>
      <strong>A. </strong>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong> Use semantic HTML elements: </strong> This means using HTML
          elements that convey the meaning of the content they contain, such as
          &lt;h1&gt; for headings and &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs. This helps
          assistive technologies understand the structure of the page and make
          it easier for users to navigate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Provide alt text for images: </strong> Alt text is a text
          description of an image that is read by assistive technologies for
          people who cannot see the image. Alt text should be concise and
          descriptive, and it should convey the essential information conveyed
          by the image.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Use keyboard-accessible navigation and form controls:
          </strong>
          This means making sure that users can interact with the page using
          only their keyboard, without having to use a mouse. This is important
          for people with disabilities who cannot use a mouse, as well as for
          people who are using mobile devices or other devices with limited
          input capabilities.
