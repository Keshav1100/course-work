    <h1>HTML5 Features</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Semantic Tags</h2>
      <p>
        HTML5 introduces a number of new semantic tags, such as `header`,
        `footer`, and `section`. These elements allow developers to better
        structure their content and make it more accessible to search engines
        and other machines.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Audio and Video</h2>
      <p>
        HTML5 includes native support for audio and video playback, without the
        need for third-party plugins like Flash or Silverlight. This makes it
        easier for developers to create rich multimedia experiences on the web.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Canvas</h2>
      <p>
        The Canvas element allows developers to create interactive graphics and
        animations directly in web pages. This opens up a lot of new
        possibilities for web applications and games.
      </p>
    </section>
    <footer>
      <p>
        These are just a few of the many new features and improvements that are
        introduced in HTML5. HTML5 is a powerful new standard that makes it
        easier for developers to create rich, interactive, and user-friendly web
        applications.
