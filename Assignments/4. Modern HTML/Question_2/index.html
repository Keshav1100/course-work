    <h1>Q. What are HTML Entities? List out 5 commonly used HTML entities.</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        <strong>A. </strong> HTML entities are used to represent special
        characters in HTML. They are used because some characters are reserved
        in HTML, and cannot be used in the text of a document without being
        interpreted as markup. For example, the less than sign (&lt;) is used to
        start an HTML tag, so if you want to display the less than sign in your
        text, you must use the HTML entity &lt;.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML entities are created by placing an ampersand (&) at the beginning
        of the entity name, and a semicolon (;) at the end. For example, the
        HTML entity for the copyright symbol is &copy;.
      </p>
      Here is a list of 5 commonly used HTML entities:
      <ul>
        <li>&amp;amp - ampersand</li>
        <li>&amp;lt; - less than</li>
        <li>&amp;gt; - greater than</li>
        <li>&amp;quot; - quotation mark</li>
        <li>&amp;copy; - copyright symbol</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        HTML entities are a powerful tool that can be used to display any
        character in your HTML document. They are especially useful for
        displaying special characters and characters that are not available on
        your keyboard.
