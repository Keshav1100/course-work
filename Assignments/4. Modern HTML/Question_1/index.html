    <h1>Q. List out the features of HTML5</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>A. </strong>
      HTML5 is the fifth and latest major version of the HTML standard, and it
      introduces a number of new features and improvements. Some of the most
      notable features of HTML5 include:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong> Semantic elements:</strong> HTML5 introduces a number of new semantic elements,
        such as &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, and &lt;section&gt;. These
        elements allow developers to better structure their content and make it
        more accessible to search engines and other machines.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Audio and video support:</strong> HTML5 includes native support for audio and
        video playback, without the need for third-party plugins like Flash or
        Silverlight. This makes it easier for developers to create rich
        multimedia experiences on the web.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Canvas element:</strong> The Canvas element allows developers to create
        interactive graphics and animations without the need for plugins. This
        opens up a lot of new possibilities for web applications and games.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Geolocation API:</strong> The Geolocation API allows developers to access a
        user's current location. This can be used to create location-aware
        applications, such as maps and navigation apps.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Local storage:</strong> Local storage allows developers to store data on the
        user's device, even after the browser is closed. This can be used to
        create more responsive and user-friendly web applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Web workers:</strong> Web workers allow developers to run scripts in the
        background, without blocking the main thread of the application. This
        can be used to improve the performance of web applications, especially
        those that perform long-running tasks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Drag and drop API:</strong> The Drag and drop API allows developers to create
        drag-and-drop interfaces in their web applications. This makes it easier
        for users to interact with web applications in a more natural and
        intuitive way.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Form enhancements:</strong> HTML5 includes a number of new enhancements to the
        HTML form element, such as new input types (email, URL, etc.),
        placeholder text, and required fields validation. These enhancements
        make it easier for developers to create user-friendly forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Web Sockets:</strong> Web Sockets allow developers to create real-time
        bidirectional communication between a web browser and a web server. This
        makes it possible to create web applications that can stream data and
        provide real-time updates to users.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      These are just a few of the many new features and improvements that are
      introduced in HTML5. HTML5 is a powerful new standard that makes it easier
      for developers to create rich, interactive, and user-friendly web
      applications.
