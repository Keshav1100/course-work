// Examples:

// This is a single-line comment
let x = 5; // Variable assignment

/*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  It can span multiple lines.
  Useful for more extensive explanations.
*/

let y = 10; // Another variable assignment

// Function to calculate the square of a number
function square(number) {
  // This is a single-line comment within the function
  return number * number; // Multiply the number by itself
}

/*
    The following code demonstrates the use of the square function.
    It calculates the square of 3 and logs the result to the console.

let result = square(3);
console.log("The square of 3 is: " + result);
