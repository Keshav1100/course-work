        Comments in JavaScript serve as annotations within the code that are not
        executed by the JavaScript engine. They are essential for enhancing code
        readability, providing explanations, and making it easier for other
        developers (or even yourself) to understand the purpose and
        functionality of different parts of the code. Here are some key reasons
        why comments are important:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Documentation:</h3>
            Comments document the code, explaining the logic, algorithms, or any
            complex operations. This is crucial for maintaining and updating
            code over time.
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Clarity:</h3>
            Well-placed comments make the code more readable and understandable,
            especially for developers who are new to the codebase or are
            reviewing the code.
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Debugging:</h3>
            Comments can be used to temporarily disable or comment out code for
            debugging purposes without removing the code entirely.
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Collaboration:</h3>
            When working in a team, comments facilitate collaboration by
            providing insights into the code's intent and usage of specific
            techniques or patterns.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Now, let's look at examples of single-line and multi-line comments in
          JavaScript:
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3><u>Single-line comments:</u></h3>
        <img
          src="./code_examples/ex_1.png"
          alt="code example"
          class="ans-code-example"
        />
        <p>
          In the example above, // denotes a single-line comment. Anything
          following // on the same line is considered a comment.
        </p>
        <h3><u>Multi-line comments:</u></h3>
        <img
          src="./code_examples/ex_2.png"
          alt="code example"
          class="ans-code-example"
        />
        <p>
          In this example, /* begins the multi-line comment, and */ ends it.
          Everything between these markers is treated as a comment, even if it
          spans multiple lines.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Here's a more practical example:</p>
        <img
          src="./code_examples/ex_3.png"
          alt="code example"
          class="ans-code-example"
        />
        <p>
          In this example, comments provide insights into the purpose of the
          code, the functionality of the square function, and the usage of the
          function to calculate and log the square of a number.
