        <p>
          In JavaScript, declaring variables serves the purpose of reserving
          memory space to store and manage data. Variables are used to store and
          manipulate values, making it easier to work with data in a program.
          Declaring variables allows developers to:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Store Data:</h3>
            Variables store values, whether they are numbers, strings, boolean
            values, objects, or other data types.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Manipulate Data:</h3>
            Variables enable the manipulation and transformation of data during
            the execution of a program. Operations can be performed on variables
            to produce desired outcomes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Reuse Values:</h3>
            By storing values in variables, you can reuse them throughout your
            code, reducing redundancy and making code more modular and
            maintainable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Dynamic Behavior:</h3>
            JavaScript variables are dynamically typed, meaning they can hold
            values different types atof different points in the code. This
            flexibility allows for dynamic behavior and adaptation based on the
            needs of the program.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Scope Management:</h3>
            Variables have scopes that determine where they can be accessed or
            modified. Proper variable declaration helps manage scope and avoid
            unintended side effects.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          To declare variables in JavaScript, the let keyword is commonly used.
          Here's how you declare a variable using let:
        </p>
        <img
          src="./code_examples/ex_1.png"
          alt="code example"
          class="ans-code-example"
        />
        <p>We can also declare and assign a value in a single line:</p>
        <img
          src="./code_examples/ex_2.png"
          alt="code example"
          class="ans-code-example"
        />

        In the example above:
        <ul>
          <li>
            &apos;<strong>let&apos;</strong> is the keyword used for variable
            declaration.
          </li>
          <li>
            &apos;<strong>variableName&apos;</strong> is the name given to the
            variable. It follows JavaScript's identifier rules.
          </li>
          <li>
            &apos;<strong>age&apos;</strong> is an example of a variable name.
          </li>
          <li>
            &apos;<strong>25&apos;</strong> is the initial value assigned to the
            variable.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It's important to note that variables declared using let are
          block-scoped, meaning their scope is limited to the block (enclosed by
          curly braces) in which they are defined. This is in contrast to
          variables declared with var, which have function-level scope.
          <br />
          Here's an example illustrating variable declaration, assignment, and
          usage:
        </p>
        <img
          src="./code_examples/ex_3.png"
          alt="code example"
          class="ans-code-example"
        />
        <p>
          In this example, the variable name is declared, assigned the value
          "John," and then used in a console.log statement to produce output.
