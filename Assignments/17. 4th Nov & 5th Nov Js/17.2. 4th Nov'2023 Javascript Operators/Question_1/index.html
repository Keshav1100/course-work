        Operators in JavaScript are critical for performing operations on
        variables and values. They enable arithmetic calculations, comparison of
        values, logical evaluations, assignment of values, and more. Operators
        are fundamental for expressing program logic, manipulating data, and
        controlling flow, making them essential tools in programming.
