    <h2>Chandrayaan-3</h2>
    <!-- Text for respective sub-heading -->
    <p>
      Chandrayaan-3 is the third lunar mission of the Indian Space Research
      Organisation (ISRO). It was launched on 14 July 2023 from the Satish
      Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. The mission consists
      of a lunar orbiter, a lander, and a rover. <br />
      <br />
      The orbiter will orbit the Moon for one year, mapping its surface and
      studying its composition. The lander, named Vikram, will touch down in the
      Moon's southern polar region. The rover, named Pragyan, will then roll out
      of the lander and explore the surrounding area.
    </p>
    <!-- Some pointers for respective sub-heading -->
    <p>The main objectives of Chandrayaan-3 are to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Soft land on the Moon's south polar region</li>
      <li>Deploy the Pragyan rover to explore the lunar surface</li>
      <li>Study the composition of the lunar soil and rocks</li>
      <li>Search for water ice in the lunar polar regions</li>
      <li>Conduct experiments to understand the lunar environment</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- Text for respective sub-heading -->
    <p>
      Chandrayaan-3 is a major milestone in India's space program. It is the
      first Indian mission to attempt a soft landing on the Moon's south polar
      region. The success of the mission will demonstrate India's technological
      prowess and its ability to undertake complex space missions.
      <br />
      <br />
      The Chandrayaan-3 mission was a success. The Vikram lander successfully
      touched down in the Moon's southern polar region on August 23, 2023. The
      Pragyan rover was then deployed from the lander and began exploring the
      surrounding area. The mission is expected to last for one year.
      <br />
      <br />
      The success of Chandrayaan-3 is a major achievement for India. It is the
      first Indian mission to successfully land on the Moon's south polar
      region. The mission will help scientists to better understand the Moon's
      composition and environment. It will also help India to develop its space
      technology and capabilities.

    <h2>Aditya-L1</h2>
    <!-- Text for respective sub-heading -->
    <p>
      Aditya-L1 is a solar observation mission of the Indian Space Research
      Organisation (ISRO). It was launched on 28 December 2022 from the Satish
      Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. The mission is named
      after Aditya, the Hindu god of the Sun. <br /><br />Aditya-L1 will be
      placed in a halo orbit around the L1 Lagrange point, which is located
      about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. The L1 point is a gravitationally
      stable location where the gravitational forces of the Sun and Earth are
      balanced. This will allow Aditya-L1 to stay in a fixed position relative
      to the Sun, so that it can continuously study the solar atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>The main objectives of Aditya-L1 are to:</p>
    <!-- Some pointers for respective sub-heading -->
    <ul>
      <li>
        Study the solar corona, the outermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere
      </li>
      <li>
        Understand the mechanisms of solar flares and coronal mass ejections
      </li>
      <li>
        Investigate the relationship between solar activity and space weather
      </li>
      <li>Develop new technologies for solar observation</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- Some pointers for respective sub-heading -->
    <p>Aditya-L1 is equipped with seven scientific instruments, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A coronagraph, which blocks out the light from the solar disk so that
        the corona can be studied
      </li>
      <li>
        A spectrograph, which can be used to study the composition of the solar
        atmosphere
      </li>
      <li>
        A magnetometer, which can be used to measure the magnetic field of the
        Sun
      </li>
      <li>
        A particle detector, which can be used to study the particles emitted by
        the Sun
      </li>
    </ul>
    <!-- Text for respective sub-heading -->
    <p>
      Aditya-L1 is expected to operate for five years. The mission will help
      scientists to better understand the Sun and its influence on Earth's
      climate and space weather. Here are some additional information about
      Aditya-L1:
    </p>
    <!-- Some pointers for respective sub-heading -->
    <ul>
      <li>
        The spacecraft is about the size of a refrigerator and weighs about
        1,500 kilograms.
      </li>
      <li>It is powered by solar panels and has a battery backup.</li>
      <li>The mission cost about 5.5 crores USD.</li>
      <li>
        The project is led by Nigar Shaji, a scientist at the Indian Institute
        of Astrophysics
      </li>
