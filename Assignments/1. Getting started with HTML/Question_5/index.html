    <p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> 
        The DOCTYPE declaration is the first line of code required in every HTML document. It is an instruction to the web browser about the type of the file being rendered like here, an HTML file gets rendered, and also, it tells about what version of HTML the page is written in. This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers.</p>
