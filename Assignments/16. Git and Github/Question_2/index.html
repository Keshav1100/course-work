          directory, and repository.

        The Git workflow involves three main components: the working directory,
        the staging area (also known as the index), and the repository.
        Understanding how these components interact is crucial for effectively
        using Git.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Working Directory:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The working directory is where you have the actual files of your
                project. These files are visible and editable by you.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you start working on a project, Git creates a working
                directory where you can modify and add files.
              </li>
              <li>
                Modifications made in the working directory are not
                automatically recorded by Git. You need to explicitly tell Git
                which changes you want to include in the next commit.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Staging Area (Index):</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The staging area is a buffer between the working directory and
                the repository.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you make changes to your files in the working directory,
                Git doesn't automatically include those changes in the next
                commit. Instead, you must use the "git add" command to move
                changes to the staging area.
              </li>
              <li>
                The staging area allows you to selectively include specific
                changes in your next commit. This is powerful because it lets
                you control which modifications are part of the commit.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Repository:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The repository is where Git permanently stores the project's
                history, including all committed changes.
              </li>
              <li>
                After you've added changes to the staging area, you use the "git
                commit" command to create a snapshot of the staging area. This
                snapshot becomes a commit, and it is stored in the Git
                repository.
              </li>
              <li>
                Commits are the building blocks of the project's history, and
                each commit has a unique identifier (hash). Commits include
                information about who made the changes, when they were made, and
                a reference to the commit's parent (previous) commit, forming a
                chain of commits.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
