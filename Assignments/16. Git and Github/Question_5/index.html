        To contribute to an open-source project on GitHub, you can follow below
        steps:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Explore Projects:</h3>
            Begin by exploring GitHub to find an open-source project that
            interests you. Look for projects that are labeled as
            beginner-friendly or have issues tagged as "good first issue."
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Fork the Repository:</h3>
            Once you've found a project, click the "Fork" button on the
            project's GitHub page. This creates a personal copy (fork) of the
            project under your GitHub account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Clone to Your Machine:</h3>
            Clone your forked repository to your local machine using Git. This
            makes a local copy of the project that you can work on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Create a Branch:</h3>
            Before making changes, create a new branch for your contribution.
            This helps keep your changes isolated and makes it easier to manage
            different features or fixes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Make Your Changes:</h3>
            Implement the changes or additions you want to contribute. Ensure
            you follow the project's guidelines for coding style and
            documentation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Commit Your Changes:</h3>
            After making your changes, commit them with a clear and concise
            message describing the purpose of your changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Push Your Changes:</h3>
            Push the committed changes to your forked repository on GitHub. This
            updates the branch you created earlier.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Create a Pull Request (PR):</h3>
            On the GitHub page of your fork, initiate a pull request. This
            notifies the original project's maintainers that you have changes
            you'd like them to consider.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Discuss and Revise:</h3>
            Engage with the project maintainers and other contributors through
            the pull request. Be open to feedback, answer questions, and make
            necessary revisions based on the discussions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Code Review:</h3>
            The project maintainers will review your changes, looking for code
            quality, adherence to project standards, and overall compatibility
            with the project.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Merge:</h3>
            Once the changes are approved, a project maintainer will merge your
            contributions into the main project. Congratulations, you've
            successfully contributed to the open-source project!
