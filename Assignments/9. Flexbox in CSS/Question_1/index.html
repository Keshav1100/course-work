          <h3>CSS Flexbox:</h3>
          <p>
            CSS Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model that operates along
            either the row or column axis. It excels at aligning items within a
            container in a single direction, offering flexibility in terms of
            alignment at the start, center, end, or stretched within the
            container. Flexbox is particularly useful for responsive design,
            enabling the distribution of space and adjustment of item sizes
            across different screen sizes. It supports the reordering of items,
            allowing for changes in visual order without altering the source
            code structure. Flexbox is well-suited for building both simple and
            nested layouts.

          <h3>CSS Grid:</h3>
          <p>
            In contrast, CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout model, working
            along both row and column axes simultaneously. It provides precise
            control over the placement of items within a grid, making it ideal
            for complex layouts. With Grid, you can define explicit grid tracks,
            specifying the number of rows and columns, as well as their sizes.
            It allows for detailed item placement using properties like
            grid-row, grid-column, and grid-area. While responsive, Grid is
            especially powerful when creating layouts involving a combination of
            rows and columns or when items need to span multiple rows or
            columns. It complements Flexbox by offering a more robust solution
            for comprehensive layouts.

          <h3>Choosing Between Flexbox and Grid:</h3>
          <p>
            The choice between Flexbox and Grid depends on the layout
            requirements. Flexbox is suitable for one-dimensional layouts, such
            as aligning items in a row or column, and is great for components
            within larger layouts. Grid, on the other hand, is chosen for more
            intricate two-dimensional layouts where precise control over both
            rows and columns is necessary. In many cases, these layout models
            are used together, with Flexbox applied at the item level within a
            Grid container to achieve a combination of flexibility and precision
            in layout design.
