      Q. Explain the difference between Absolute and Relative positioning.

    <h2>A.</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <h3>Absolute Positioning</h3>
      <p>
        Absolute positioning involves placing an HTML element
        <u> relative to its nearest positioned ancestor</u> or, if none exists,
        relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport). The
        element is <u> removed from the normal document flow</u>, meaning it
        doesn't affect the position of other elements. The precise position is
        determined using the top, right, bottom, or left properties. This method
        is commonly employed for creating overlays or pop-up menus, where the
        element needs to be positioned precisely on the page, independently of
        other elements.

      <h3>Realtive Positioning</h3>
      <p>
        Relative positioning positions an HTML element
        <u> relative to its normal position </u> in the document flow. The
        element <u> retains its space in the normal flow </u>, affecting the
        positioning of other elements around it. Like absolute positioning, the
        top, right, bottom, or left properties can be used to offset the element
        from its default position. This method is useful for making small
        adjustments to the position of elements while keeping them in the
        document flow. Unlike absolute positioning, it doesn't remove the
        element from the normal flow, making it suitable for scenarios where the
        element should still occupy space on the page.
