      <h2>Q. Explain the z-index, with a code example.</h2>
      <h2>A.</h2>
      <p>
        The z-index property in CSS is used to control the stacking order of
        positioned elements along the z-axis (front-to-back). This property is
        particularly useful when we have overlapping elements on a webpage, and
        we want to specify which element should appear on top
      </p>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <div class="example">
        <div class="box" id="box1">Box-1</div>
        <div class="box" id="box2">Box-2</div>
      </div>
      <p>
        In below example, even though box-1 was created before so it should
        appear behind, but since it has a higher z-index property, it is
        appearing in front/on top.
