    <h1>Q. Define Favicon and give an illustrative example.</h1>
    <div>
      <strong>A. </strong>
      <p>
        A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small, typically square or
        rectangular graphic icon that is associated with a website or web page.
        It is displayed in the browser's address bar, next to the page's title
        in browser tabs, and in bookmarks or favorites lists. Favicon images are
        usually very small, often 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels in size, and are
        intended to visually represent the website or provide a recognizable
        logo or branding element for the site.
      </p>
      <p>Favicons serve several purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong> Branding:</strong> Favicons help reinforce a website's
          branding by displaying a recognizable logo or symbol associated with
          the site.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Visual Identification:</strong> They make it easier for users
          to quickly identify and switch between open tabs in their web
          browsers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Bookmarking:</strong> When users bookmark a page, the favicon
          is often displayed alongside the page title in the bookmarks list,
          making it easier to locate the desired bookmark.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Professionalism:</strong> Including a favicon adds a polished
          and professional touch to a website, enhancing its overall user
          experience.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
